{"name":"WRONG Prototype","tagline":"Weaponified Reverse pONG - Marmalade Quick demo game - prototype version","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub page for The WRONG prototype\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the source for a prototype Marmalade Quick game.\r\n\r\nIt was built as part of a blog series on getting started with Marmalade Quick, by Marmalade employee (and owner of this github account) Nick Smith. Marmalade Quick is 2D rapid development middleware that ships with the Marmalade cross platform SDK. It allows you to code 2D games quickly using Lua and, combined with the regular Marmalade tools, lets you easily publish to mobile platforms, PC and Mac.\r\n\r\nThe original blog posts started from this page:\r\nhttp://www.madewithmarmalade.com/blog/building-marmalade-quick-game-nick-smith-part-1-getting-started\r\n\r\nThe Marmalade website was re-designed in late 2013 and the blog is currently being moved. In the meantime, you may be able to access the old version by replacing \"www\" with \"legacy\" in the URLs. For example:\r\nhttp://legacy.madewithmarmalade.com/blog/building-marmalade-quick-game-nick-smith-part-1-getting-started\r\n\r\n### Blog Posts\r\n\r\nThe Quick blog posts are reproduced below...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe prototype and blog are both written by Nick Smith @nickmarmalade.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
