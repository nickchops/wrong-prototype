WRONG (prototype)
-----------------

Wrong (Weaponified Reverse pONG) is a game by Nick Smith, built from scratch using Marmalade Quick.

Marmalade Quick is a 2D rapid app dev toolkit that runs on top of the Marmalade SDK:

You need a Marmalade license to build the code as-is and to deploy to devices. Wrong should build and run on any device that supports Quick (Android, iOS, BlackBerry 10, PlayBook, PC and Mac desktop)

This prototype version was built to accompany a set of tutorial blogs from the Marmalade developer website. The code here is from part 3 of the blog posts.

See the Github page for more info and a complete up-dated reproduction of the original blog posts:

Those original blog posts started here:

A more advanced version Wrong (v 0.7) is available on the BlackBerry World store for BB10 as a proof of concept.

Wrong v1 will be uploaded to a whole bunch of stores and github when ready along with accompanying blog posts.
